## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- iOS Simulator (macOS) or Android Studio (for emulators)
- Expo Go app (for physical device testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd budget-tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. Run on your preferred platform:
   - **iOS Simulator**: Press `i` in the terminal
   - **Android Emulator**: Press `a` in the terminal
   - **Physical Device**: Scan the QR code with Expo Go app

### Development

The project uses file-based routing with Expo Router. Main screens are located in:

- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Dashboard screen
- `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Transaction list
- `app/(tabs)/budgets.tsx` - Budget management
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` - App settings

### Building for Production

```bash
# Create a production build
npx expo build:ios
npx expo build:android

# Or use EAS Build for cloud builds
npx expo eas:build --platform ios
npx expo eas:build --platform android
```

## Configuration

Key configuration files:

- `app.json` - Expo configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript settings
- `eslint.config.js` - Linting rules
- `metro.config.js` - Metro bundler configuration

## Data Models

The app uses strongly-typed data models:

- **Transaction**: Individual expense/income records
- **Account**: Bank accounts, credit cards, etc.
- **Budget**: Spending limits by category
- **Goal**: Financial objectives and targets
- **Insight**: AI-generated recommendations

## Security

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive financial data
- Biometric authentication support
- Secure key storage using device keychain
- HTTPS-only API communication
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Performance

- Optimized React Native components with proper memoization
- Efficient state management with Zustand
- Lazy loading of screens and heavy components
- Image optimization and caching
- Background data synchronization
